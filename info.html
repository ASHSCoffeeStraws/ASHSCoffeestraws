                     <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>
                    Our mission with this business is to reach the goals we have set for ourselves to a high standard and to be a sustainable business that also accumulates a good amount of product.
                    To do this we will conduct research on our target market and analyse what our market wants from our product and what price they were willing to pay for it and in what quantity.
                    We want to create a product that people could use as everyday alternative to a regular coffee, this is a good replacement for people who struggle with a coffee addictions and want to become healthier and reduce the need for regular coffee in their everyday lives.
                    The coffee straw is a weaker form of coffee seeing as it is just flavouring the milk used in the drink it reduces excess sugar and caffeine.
                    The coffee straws could also be used by the everyday consumer as not only an alternate choice but also a preferred choice when compared to a regular coffee.
